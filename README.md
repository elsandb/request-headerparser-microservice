# Request Header Parser Microservice Project - [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org)

This repository contains a JavaScript app providing an API endpoint for retrieving request header information.

The project is built on top of freeCodeCamp's boilerplate code, available from https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-project-headerparser/.

The implementation of the API endpoint follows the specifications given in the [project requirements](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/back-end-development-and-apis-projects/timestamp-microservice).

## Usage
Clone this repo, run `npm install`, then `npm run start` -> the server will start in watch mode (i.e.,`node --watch index.js`), which means that changes in the code will be recompiled when saved. Go to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser, and you should se the index page of the Request Header Parser Microservice.
